Weapon merging! Infinite ammo! Bee/Conference Call! Evil Smasher SMASH! 

Bring back some community favorite glitches that no-fun Gearbox patched out.

## Features

### Weapon Merging
By opening your inventory in the middle of the weapon swap animation and changing weapons, you can keep some effects 
from you weapons active even when it's in another equipped slot. Want your Unkempt Harold to heal you? Just merge your 
Moxxxi weapon onto it. Want insane critical hit damage on your sniper? Merge two Lady Fists and a Grog Nozzle onto it.

### Skill Stacking
For weapons that activate a skill by holding it, you can swap away and back quickly to "stack" the skill. The most well
known version of this is getting multiple stacks of infinite ammo from a Vladof launcher. This also is what made the 
Evil Smasher glitch possible. Swapping away and back many times just about guarantees that a Smasher reload will proc 
several of its SMASH skills, giving extreme mag, fire rate and damage bonuses. These bonuses can be transferred to 
other weapons as well using the weapon merge mechanic to not lose any stacks.

### Amp Damage
Remember when the Conference Call and Bee could be used to shred just about any enemy? This feature gives full amp
damage to every projectile, both listed and unlisted. 

### Keybinds
For those of us who like to take advantage of the occasional glitch, but hate spending all the time to stack (looking 
at you, Buckup), several keybinds are available to automatically set "stacks" of the skill glitch.

These keybinds allow you to enter your desired number of stacks
- Buckup stacks for Gaige
- Free shot stacks (from Vladof launcher)
- Evil Smasher SMASH stacks
- Gaige/Maya kill skill glitch stacks
- Axton Expertise stacks - this is a Co-op glitch, but now you can have the movement speed fun in single player

Additionally, there's a keybind to automatically merge all currently equipped weapons without having to do the menu 
swapping.
