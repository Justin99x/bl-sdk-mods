# AnyPercentHelper

BL2 mod that enables various glitches and tricks to help practice Any% Gaige speedruns. Gaige in particular is hard to 
practice late game due to the route including a large build up of anarchy stacks and buck up stacks. In addition, the
speedrun is done on patch 1.1, which does not support Python SDK mods, making it impossible to use useful practice tools 
such as Apple's Borderlands Cheats and Mopioid's Commander, which allow for things like infinite ammo and moving around 
the map instantly.

## Features

### Add or remove Buck Up stacks
Using in game keybinds, add or remove a "stack" of Buck Up.

### Add anarchy stacks
Notifies the game that 10 reloads were performed while in combat. Without skill points in Rational Anarchist or 
Typeclast Iconoclast, this has the effect of adding exactly 10 stacks of Anarchy.

### Amp damage glitch
Kind of a hacky solution that multiplies amp shield bonus by the number of pellets on the card when applying the bonus
to the weapon. In effect this mimics the behavior of old game versions that applied full amp damage to every pellet. 

### Weapon merging
Mimics the old weapon merging glitch that keeps various weapon bonuses the player starts swap, enters inventory, and
swaps the weapon out that they were holding. The game never removes the bonuses from the original gun when this happens.

In addition, can set a keybind to automatically merge bonuses from all weapons in the backpack. Useful for practicing
late game segments without wanting to manually merge weapons each time.

### Vladof free shot glitch
Allows stacking of infinite ammo using a Vladof launcher like in old versions of the game. An infinite ammo stack can be
added by firing until the free shot is next and either
1) swap away and back to the launcher quickly (and waiting for the ammo graphic to reappear), or
2) drop and pickup the launcher

In addition, can set a keybind to automatically add or remove a stack of infinite ammo. Useful for practicing
late game segments without wanting to manually use the launcher to add stacks.
